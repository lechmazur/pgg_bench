Above is the text from a multi-round public-goods game, showing only players' public messages. 
We want you to extract exactly three quotes (or fewer, if fewer qualify). 

We only care about the most dramatic, surprising, memorable, outlandish, eccentric, comedic, 
biting, or shocking lines that stand out even without context. 
We do NOT care about strategy, normal suggestions, or mild statements.

For each quote you choose, you must produce the following tags in **this** order:

<round>ROUND_NUMBER</round>
<subround>SUBROUND_NUMBER</subround>
<speaker>SPEAKER_ID</speaker>
<quote>EXCERPT_OF_MESSAGE</quote>
<rating>SCORE_0_to_10</rating>

Follow these rules:
- You are a tough critic. 
- We want each rating from 0..10, where 10 is extremely theatrical and jarring, 
  and 0 means completely mundane. 
- Return exactly one set of tags per quote. 
- If only part of a speaker's text meets the standard (the especially biting or comedic portion), 
  isolate that portion in <quote></quote>.
- Return them in descending order of rating (highest first). 
- Do not provide any extra explanation or disclaimers.
- If you find fewer than three quotes that meet the criteria, return only those that qualify.

Example minimal format:

<round>2</round>
<subround>0</subround>
<speaker>P3</speaker>
<quote>I can't believe you're wasting tokens again!</quote>
<rating>8</rating>

(Then the next quote block, etc.)
